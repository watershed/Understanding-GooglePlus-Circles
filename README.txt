Let's begin with a convention for the sake of brevity: G+ == Google+ == Google Plus.

Google's own help on G+ Circles is kind of light on visuals. There's a nice video intro to creating Circles and adding people to them but the Circles interface is wonderfully intuitive anyway.

Figuring out how the Circle decisions you make as a G+ user interact with those of everyone else's is less obvious.

I'm sure Google will enrich their own help docs soon to address this but until they do, or someone else beats them to it with some nicely made video, the aim of this project is to fill the gap.

This Github repository provides the source files for a set of 'slides' posted inside G+ as a Photos album. The core source file I've been working with is a layered Adobe Illustrator CS3 file and it uses the Helvetica Neue font family that is native to Mac OS X. Using an Illustrator file is probably not an optimal choice so feel free to fork and provide different origination.

Adapt and use this work freely but do please credit me, Jonathan Schofield, somewhere.
